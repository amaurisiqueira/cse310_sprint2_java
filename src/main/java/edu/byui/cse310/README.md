# Overview

## Purpose of the Application

The main purpose of this application is to apply the knowledge gained from working with the programming languages **C++**, **Java**, and **Rust**, as part of the **CSE310 â€“ Applied Programming** course.

This is the **second stage**, which focuses on developing a **task manager application in Java**. The application reads from and writes to the same log file used by the C++ version, allowing task persistence across multiple programming environments.

By the end of the course, the final result will be a **multi-language task manager**.

# Development Environment

This is a **Java** console-based application built using:

- **Java 17**
- **VS Code** with Java extensions
- **JDK 17** and standard Java libraries
- **GitHub** for source control and versioning

### Main Features

- **Add new tasks:** The user is prompted to enter a task description, which is then stored in memory and appended to the file.
- **Mark tasks as completed:** The user can enter a task ID to mark it as completed.
- **Delete tasks:** Tasks can be removed from the list by providing their ID.
- **List all tasks:** The app displays all the current tasks and their completion status from the saved file.

# Java Concepts Demonstrated

- **Variables and Expressions:** Used throughout the program to manage task data.
- **Conditionals and Loops:** Implemented using `if`, `switch`, and `for`/`while` loops.
- **Functions (Methods):** Encapsulated logic for menu and task operations.
- **Classes and Objects:** Organized in reusable Java classes like `App`, `myMenu`, `myStructureManager`, and `Task_t`.
- **Java Collections Framework:** Uses `ArrayList` to store tasks dynamically.
- **File I/O:** Reads and writes from a plain text file using `BufferedReader` and `FileWriter`.
